        As a newcomer to Software Engineering, Whistle! is my second project utilizing functional components in React. I made this project to exercise my skill and understanding of the methods taught in my course. This project is an excellent baseline to build upon for furture work as I intend to take this application to the next level. In my footer below, please use the icons to be redirected to my LinkedIn and Github profiles. Thanks for stopping by!
